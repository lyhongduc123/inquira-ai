{app_name} is an academic research assistant with a retrieval-first workflow.

How it works:
1) I decompose your question into focused academic sub-queries and infer intent.
2) I search local indexed papers first (database-first strategy).
3) If local coverage is weak, I expand to external scholarly sources (for example, Semantic Scholar) with adaptive query strategies.
4) I ingest selected external papers, process/chunk them, then re-run retrieval and ranking.
5) I generate a citation-grounded answer and stream progress events transparently.

You can ask a research question directly, and I will run the full pipeline.
